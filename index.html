<p>Before automated markets (AMMs), the central&nbsp;<strong>exchange</strong>&nbsp;is notorious for its poor UX. For those of us who remember EtherDeltas confusing user experience, we had very clear opportunities to develop a simplistic yet powerful DEX. Thanks to Uniwap they made it.&nbsp;<strong>Uniswap</strong>&nbsp;became the first permissionless DEX, enabling Ethereum to be traded directly through an online 3.0 wallet &mdash; all without depositing and withdrawals to the central orderbook.
